# 04 Code Quiz
> Built a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions

This was a homework assignment where we built a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by a few JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Completed
* Created the HTML and CSS from scratch
* Added quiz logic using event delgation and highscore logic using the localStorage
